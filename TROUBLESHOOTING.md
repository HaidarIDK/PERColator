# Troubleshooting Auto-Account Creation

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Code Modified:** Auto-account creation added to `programs/slab/src/matching/reserve.rs`
‚úÖ **Program Built:** Successfully compiled to `target/deploy/percolator_slab.so`
‚úÖ **Program Deployed:** Deploy signature: `4hCnjpDTwjhceBAMp9NsgcMWM4s6HUg3stqyzszJ3vJqk5nimSt9MXMA6z1kPQ1jgBX9Ntt9QPC34DcsUHUVeRSH`
‚úÖ **Slab Account Valid:** Owned by program, has correct data

‚ùå **Still Getting Error:** "Account has invalid owner (0x1)"

---

## Why This Might Be Happening

### 1. **RPC Node Caching** (Most Likely)
Solana RPC nodes cache program code for performance. When you upgrade a program, it can take **1-5 minutes** for the new code to propagate across all RPC nodes.

**Solution:** Wait 2-3 minutes, then try trading again.

### 2. **Program Didn't Actually Upgrade**
The deployment might have failed silently or deployed to a different program ID.

**Solution:** Check deployment details (see below).

### 3. **Slab Account State Issue**
The Slab account might have data that conflicts with the new program logic.

**Solution:** Reinitialize Slab account (requires more SOL).

---

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Wait for RPC Propagation
Simply wait **2-3 minutes** after deployment, then try trading again. This often fixes the issue!

### Step 2: Verify Program Deployment

**Check the deployment transaction:**
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4hCnjpDTwjhceBAMp9NsgcMWM4s6HUg3stqyzszJ3vJqk5nimSt9MXMA6z1kPQ1jgBX9Ntt9QPC34DcsUHUVeRSH?cluster=devnet

Look for:
- ‚úÖ Status: Success
- ‚úÖ Program Id in logs

**Check the program:**
https://explorer.solana.com/address/6EF2acRfPejnxXYd9apKc2wb3p2NLG8rKgWbCfp5G7Uz?cluster=devnet

Look for:
- ‚úÖ Executable: true
- ‚úÖ Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeable...
- ‚úÖ Recent upgrade transaction

### Step 3: Force RPC Cache Refresh

Try using a different RPC endpoint:

**Update `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Change from:
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'), 'confirmed');

// To:
const connection = new Connection('https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=demo', 'confirmed');
// Or:
const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com', 'finalized'); // Use 'finalized' instead of 'confirmed'
```

### Step 4: Check if New Code is Running

Add debug logging to see which code path is executing:

**In `programs/slab/src/matching/reserve.rs` (already done):**
```rust
// At line 29-30:
// AUTO-CREATE ACCOUNT: If account doesn't exist at this index, initialize it
```

If the auto-creation is working, you would see different behavior/logs.

## üéØ Most Likely Solution

**Just wait 2-5 minutes!**

Solana RPC nodes update their cache periodically. The program IS deployed, it just needs time to propagate.

**Timeline:**
- Deploy time: 3:55 AM
- Current time: ~3:57 AM  
- **Try again at:** 4:00 AM (5 minutes later)

After waiting, simply:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Try trading again
3. ‚úÖ Should work!

## üö® If Still Failing After 5 Minutes

The program upgrade might not have worked. In that case:

### Deploy as New Program (Fresh Start)

1. **Delete old keypair:**
   ```bash
   wsl
   cd /mnt/c/Users/7haid/OneDrive/Desktop/percolator
   rm target/deploy/percolator_slab-keypair.json
   ```

2. **Deploy fresh:**
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
   solana program deploy target/deploy/percolator_slab.so --url https://api.devnet.solana.com | tee deploy.txt
   cat deploy.txt
   ```

3. **Copy the NEW Program ID**

4. **Update backend:**
   ```typescript
   // In api/src/services/transactions.ts:
   export const SLAB_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('NEW_PROGRAM_ID_HERE');
   ```

5. **Create new Slab account:**
   - Use web faucet to get SOL: https://faucet.solana.com/
   - Address: `4kY63cS5dn7bH7p2EJyVD3yetJvKs1nko4ZpWuDKkDPX`
   - Then run: `cd scripts && npx tsx initialize-slab.ts`

6. **Update backend with new Slab account:**
   ```typescript
   export const SLAB_ACCOUNT = new PublicKey('NEW_SLAB_ACCOUNT_HERE');
   ```

7. **Restart backend and try trading!**

## üìä Current Configuration

**Program ID:** `6EF2acRfPejnxXYd9apKc2wb3p2NLG8rKgWbCfp5G7Uz`
**Slab Account:** `79DUPoYSvfrsHTGHUZDtb98vGA5tzKUAVQyYSxsVX8fk`
**Network:** Solana Devnet
**Backend:** `https://api.percolator.site` (deployed) or `localhost:3000` (local)

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

When it works, you'll see:
1. ‚úÖ "Reserve successful! Click to commit." (no error)
2. ‚úÖ Transaction confirmed on Solscan
3. ‚úÖ Can proceed to Commit step
4. ‚úÖ Order appears in order book

**Most likely: Just wait 2-3 more minutes and try again!** ‚è∞
