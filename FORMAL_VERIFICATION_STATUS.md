# Formal Verification Status

## Summary

We've implemented a **layered approach** to Kani formal verification, starting with minimal concrete proofs and gradually increasing complexity. This approach balances verification coverage with tractable proof times.

## Current Status (October 24, 2025)

### ✅ Phase 1: Minimal Concrete Proofs (COMPLETE)
**All 7 proofs verified in <10 seconds total**

Located in: `/home/anatoly/percolator/crates/proofs/kani/src/minimal.rs`

#### Level 1: Concrete Single-User Tests (4 proofs)
These use concrete values for fast verification of core invariants:

1. **`i1_concrete_single_user`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Invariant**: I1 (Principal Inviolability)
   - **Test**: 1 user with 1000 principal, 500 PnL, 100 deficit
   - **Verifies**: Principal unchanged after socialization
   - **Runtime**: <1s

2. **`i3_concrete_unauthorized`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Invariant**: I3 (Authorization)
   - **Test**: Unauthorized router attempts deposit/withdrawal
   - **Verifies**: Operations fail without authorization
   - **Runtime**: <1s

3. **`i6_concrete_matcher`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Invariant**: I6 (Matcher Can't Move Funds)
   - **Test**: Matcher noise applied to concrete state
   - **Verifies**: Balances unchanged
   - **Runtime**: <1s

4. **`deposit_concrete`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Operation**: deposit(500)
   - **Verifies**: Principal +500, Vault +500
   - **Runtime**: <1s

5. **`withdrawal_concrete`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Operation**: withdraw_principal(300)
   - **Verifies**: Principal -300, Vault -300
   - **Runtime**: <1s

#### Level 2: Small Bounded Symbolic Tests (2 proofs)
These use small symbolic values (u8) for increased coverage:

6. **`i1_bounded_deficit`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Invariant**: I1 (Principal Inviolability)
   - **Test**: Concrete 1-user state, symbolic deficit (u8: 0-255)
   - **Verifies**: Principal unchanged for all deficit values
   - **Runtime**: ~3s

7. **`deposit_bounded_amount`** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Operation**: deposit(u8: 0-255)
   - **Verifies**: Principal/vault monotonicity for all amounts
   - **Runtime**: ~3s

### 🚧 Phase 2: Medium Complexity Proofs (PENDING)

The original proofs in `safety.rs` use full symbolic state generation and are currently **intractable** (>hours of runtime due to state space explosion):

**Issues**:
- `any_state_bounded()` generates 1-2 users but still creates massive state space
- Even with ultra-small bounds (MAX_VAL=1000), state generation takes 2000+ iterations
- The generator uses `any()` for multiple fields → combinatorial explosion

**Blocked Proofs**:
- `i2_conservation_holds_across_short_adversary_sequences` (8 loop unwinds)
- `i4_socialization_hits_winners_only_and_caps`
- `i5_withdraw_throttle_safety`
- `deposit_increases_principal_and_vault` (currently running, stuck at state gen)
- `principal_withdrawal_reduces_principal`

## Next Steps: Gradual Complexity Increase

### Strategy

Instead of arbitrary symbolic state, use **parameterized concrete scenarios** with small symbolic inputs:

1. **Fixed state structure, symbolic parameters**
   - 1-2 users with concrete baseline values
   - Small symbolic deltas (u8/u16) for amounts
   - Concrete warmup params, symbolic steps

2. **Multi-user scenarios**
   - 2 users: winner + loser
   - 2 users: both winners with different PnL
   - 3 users: winner, loser, neutral

3. **Gradually relax constraints**
   - Start: u8 symbolic values (0-255)
   - Middle: u16 with modulo bounds (0-10K)
   - Advanced: Full u128 with assumes

### Proposed Phase 2 Proofs

#### I2: Conservation (Multi-Step)
```rust
#[kani::proof]
fn i2_conservation_2users_3steps() {
    // Concrete 2-user initial state
    let state = make_2user_state(1000, 500, -200);  // user0: 1000p/500pnl, user1: 1000p/-200pnl

    // Symbolic: 3 operations with bounded amounts
    let op1: u8 = kani::any();  // 0-255
    let op2: u8 = kani::any();
    let op3: u8 = kani::any();

    // Apply 3 adversarial steps
    let s1 = bounded_adversary_step(state, op1);
    let s2 = bounded_adversary_step(s1, op2);
    let s3 = bounded_adversary_step(s2, op3);

    kani::assert(s3.vault < u128::MAX, "I2: No vault overflow");
}
```

#### I4: Bounded Socialization
```rust
#[kani::proof]
fn i4_socialization_2users_symbolic_deficit() {
    // Concrete: winner (500 PnL) + loser (-200 PnL)
    let state = make_2user_winner_loser(1000, 500, 1000, -200);

    // Symbolic deficit (0-1023)
    let deficit: u16 = kani::any();
    kani::assume(deficit < 1024);

    let before = state.clone();
    let after = socialize_losses(state, deficit as u128);

    kani::assert(winners_only_haircut(&before, &after), "I4: Winners only");
    kani::assert(total_haircut(&before, &after) <= deficit as u128, "I4: Bounded");
}
```

#### I5: Withdraw Throttle
```rust
#[kani::proof]
fn i5_throttle_symbolic_step_and_amount() {
    // Concrete 1-user state with warmup
    let state = make_1user_warmup(1000, 500, 10);  // slope=10

    // Symbolic: withdrawal step (0-15) and amount (0-255)
    let step: u8 = kani::any();
    kani::assume(step < 16);
    let amount: u8 = kani::any();

    let before = state.clone();
    let after = withdraw_pnl(state, 0, amount as u128, step as u32);

    let max_allowed = (step as u128) * 10;
    let withdrawn = calculate_withdrawn(&before, &after, 0);

    kani::assert(withdrawn <= max_allowed + 1, "I5: Throttle respected");
    kani::assert(after.vault <= before.vault, "I5: Vault decreases");
}
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create `medium.rs` module** with helper functions:
   - `make_1user_state(principal, pnl, slope) -> State`
   - `make_2user_winner_loser(...) -> State`
   - `bounded_adversary_step(state, op: u8) -> State`
   - `calculate_withdrawn(before, after, uid) -> u128`

2. **Implement 5 medium proofs**:
   - I2: Conservation (2 users, 3 steps)
   - I4: Socialization (2 users, symbolic deficit)
   - I5: Throttle (1 user, symbolic step + amount)
   - Deposit multi-user
   - Withdrawal with PnL vesting

3. **Verify runtime < 60s per proof**

4. **Phase 3: Advanced proofs** (if needed):
   - 3-user scenarios
   - Longer adversarial sequences (5-10 steps)
   - Larger symbolic bounds (u16/u32)

## Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `crates/proofs/kani/src/minimal.rs` | Level 1-2 proofs (concrete + small symbolic) | ✅ Complete (7 proofs) |
| `crates/proofs/kani/src/safety.rs` | Original complex proofs | ❌ Intractable (state explosion) |
| `crates/proofs/kani/src/generators.rs` | Arbitrary state generation | ⚠️ Too complex |
| `crates/proofs/kani/src/sanitizer.rs` | State space bounds | ⚠️ Still too large |
| `crates/proofs/kani/src/adversary.rs` | Adversarial step selection | ⚠️ Needs simplification |
| `crates/model_safety/src/` | Pure Rust safety model | ✅ Complete |

## Recommendations

1. **Short term (today)**:
   - Focus on minimal.rs proofs
   - These are **fast, verifiable, and cover core invariants**
   - Add 5-10 more concrete scenario tests

2. **Medium term (this week)**:
   - Implement medium.rs with parameterized concrete proofs
   - Target 10-15 medium proofs covering all 6 invariants
   - Ensure all proofs complete in <60s

3. **Long term (optional)**:
   - Revisit safety.rs with smarter state generation
   - Consider SAW/CBMC alternatives for full symbolic
   - Model-check against actual Solana program bytecode

## Performance Comparison

| Proof Type | State Size | Runtime | Coverage | Tractable? |
|------------|-----------|---------|----------|------------|
| Concrete (minimal.rs) | Fixed 1-2 users | <1s | Specific scenarios | ✅ Yes |
| Bounded Symbolic (minimal.rs) | Fixed structure, u8 params | 1-5s | 256-65K cases | ✅ Yes |
| Full Symbolic (safety.rs) | 1-2 users, all fields symbolic | **Hours+** | Billions of cases | ❌ No |

## Conclusion

The **layered verification approach** successfully balances coverage with tractability:
- **7/7 minimal proofs verified** in <10s total
- Core invariants (I1, I3, I6) proven for concrete scenarios
- Foundation laid for gradual complexity increase
- Clear path forward to comprehensive formal verification

**Next action**: Implement `medium.rs` with 5-10 parameterized proofs targeting <60s verification times.
