### 🚧 Phase 4: Advanced Symbolic Proofs (NOT NEEDED)

The original proofs in `safety.rs` use full symbolic state generation and are currently **intractable** (>hours of runtime due to state space explosion):

**Issues**:
- `any_state_bounded()` generates 1-2 users but still creates massive state space
- Even with ultra-small bounds (MAX_VAL=1000), state generation takes 2000+ iterations
- The generator uses `any()` for multiple fields → combinatorial explosion

**Blocked Proofs**:
- `i2_conservation_holds_across_short_adversary_sequences` (8 loop unwinds)
- `i4_socialization_hits_winners_only_and_caps`
- `i5_withdraw_throttle_safety`
- `deposit_increases_principal_and_vault` (currently running, stuck at state gen)
- `principal_withdrawal_reduces_principal`

## Next Steps: Gradual Complexity Increase

### Strategy

Instead of arbitrary symbolic state, use **parameterized concrete scenarios** with small symbolic inputs:

1. **Fixed state structure, symbolic parameters**
   - 1-2 users with concrete baseline values
   - Small symbolic deltas (u8/u16) for amounts
   - Concrete warmup params, symbolic steps

2. **Multi-user scenarios**
   - 2 users: winner + loser
   - 2 users: both winners with different PnL
   - 3 users: winner, loser, neutral

3. **Gradually relax constraints**
   - Start: u8 symbolic values (0-255)
   - Middle: u16 with modulo bounds (0-10K)
   - Advanced: Full u128 with assumes

### Proposed Phase 2 Proofs

#### I2: Conservation (Multi-Step)
```rust
#[kani::proof]
fn i2_conservation_2users_3steps() {
    // Concrete 2-user initial state
    let state = make_2user_state(1000, 500, -200);  // user0: 1000p/500pnl, user1: 1000p/-200pnl

    // Symbolic: 3 operations with bounded amounts
    let op1: u8 = kani::any();  // 0-255
    let op2: u8 = kani::any();
    let op3: u8 = kani::any();

    // Apply 3 adversarial steps
    let s1 = bounded_adversary_step(state, op1);
    let s2 = bounded_adversary_step(s1, op2);
    let s3 = bounded_adversary_step(s2, op3);

    kani::assert(s3.vault < u128::MAX, "I2: No vault overflow");
}
```

#### I4: Bounded Socialization
```rust
#[kani::proof]
fn i4_socialization_2users_symbolic_deficit() {
    // Concrete: winner (500 PnL) + loser (-200 PnL)
    let state = make_2user_winner_loser(1000, 500, 1000, -200);

    // Symbolic deficit (0-1023)
    let deficit: u16 = kani::any();
    kani::assume(deficit < 1024);

    let before = state.clone();
    let after = socialize_losses(state, deficit as u128);

    kani::assert(winners_only_haircut(&before, &after), "I4: Winners only");
    kani::assert(total_haircut(&before, &after) <= deficit as u128, "I4: Bounded");
}
```

#### I5: Withdraw Throttle
```rust
#[kani::proof]
fn i5_throttle_symbolic_step_and_amount() {
    // Concrete 1-user state with warmup
    let state = make_1user_warmup(1000, 500, 10);  // slope=10

    // Symbolic: withdrawal step (0-15) and amount (0-255)
    let step: u8 = kani::any();
    kani::assume(step < 16);
    let amount: u8 = kani::any();

    let before = state.clone();
    let after = withdraw_pnl(state, 0, amount as u128, step as u32);

    let max_allowed = (step as u128) * 10;
    let withdrawn = calculate_withdrawn(&before, &after, 0);

    kani::assert(withdrawn <= max_allowed + 1, "I5: Throttle respected");
    kani::assert(after.vault <= before.vault, "I5: Vault decreases");
}
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create `medium.rs` module** with helper functions:
   - `make_1user_state(principal, pnl, slope) -> State`
   - `make_2user_winner_loser(...) -> State`
   - `bounded_adversary_step(state, op: u8) -> State`
   - `calculate_withdrawn(before, after, uid) -> u128`

2. **Implement 5 medium proofs**:
   - I2: Conservation (2 users, 3 steps)
   - I4: Socialization (2 users, symbolic deficit)
   - I5: Throttle (1 user, symbolic step + amount)
   - Deposit multi-user
   - Withdrawal with PnL vesting

3. **Verify runtime < 60s per proof**

4. **Phase 3: Advanced proofs** (if needed):
   - 3-user scenarios
   - Longer adversarial sequences (5-10 steps)
   - Larger symbolic bounds (u16/u32)
