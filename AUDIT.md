# Percolator Project Audit

## Overview

Percolator is a formally-verified perpetual exchange protocol for Solana, implementing O(1) crisis loss socialization.

**Important Note:** The project is explicitly marked for educational use only and has not been audited for production use.

## Project Structure

- **Language:** Rust (no_std compatible)
- **Platform:** Solana
- **Formal Verification:** Kani proofs
- **Build System:** Cargo workspace with 13 members

## Key Components

### Crates
- `model_safety`: Core safety logic, including crisis loss socialization module with formal proofs
- `amm_model`: AMM (Automated Market Maker) model
- `adapter_core`: Adapter core functionality
- `proofs`: Formal verification proofs

### Programs
- `router`: Global coordinator for collateral, portfolios, and trade routing
- `slab`: Order book matcher program
- `amm`: AMM program
- `oracle`: Oracle program
- `common`: Shared utilities

### Other
- `cli`: Command-line interface
- `keeper`: Keeper bot
- `tests`: Integration and end-to-end tests
- `docs`: Documentation

## Dependencies

- **Pinocchio:** Solana program framework (v0.9.2)
- **Solana SDK:** v2.1
- **Proptest:** Property-based testing
- **Tokio:** Async runtime

## Security and Quality

- **Formal Verification:** 5 Kani proofs for critical invariants in crisis module
- **Test Coverage:** 257 unit tests passing
- **Linting:** Clippy warnings include profile issues for non-root packages
- **Known Issues:** None identified; no cargo audit run due to tool not installed

## Recommendations

1. Install and run `cargo audit` to check for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Address the clippy warning about workspace profiles
3. For production use, conduct a full security audit despite formal verification
4. Review the crisis loss socialization logic thoroughly, as it's critical for financial systems

## Conclusion

The codebase appears well-structured with strong emphasis on safety through formal verification. However, as stated, it is not ready for production and should only be used for educational purposes.
