# Placeholder and TODO Audit Report

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive audit of the Percolator codebase identified 15 placeholders, 8 TODO comments, and multiple incomplete features. While most are low-risk development artifacts, several have medium to high impact on security, functionality, and test coverage.

**Overall Assessment: REQUIRES ATTENTION** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Security Impact**: Medium-High (funding over-application risk, missing LP insolvency tests)
- **Functionality Impact**: Medium (incomplete AMM/LP features limit DEX capabilities)
- **Test Coverage Impact**: High (significant gaps in critical test scenarios)

## TODO Comments Found (8 locations)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Security Impact

#### 1. Funding Application Mapping Issue
**Location**: `programs/router/src/instructions/execute_cross_slab.rs:130-142`
**Issue**: TODO acknowledges potential over-application of funding rates
**Risk**: Users could be charged funding multiple times per transaction
**Impact**: Financial loss for users, unfair fee collection
```rust
// TODO: We need a way to map slab_idx to slab_pubkey to check if this exposure
// belongs to the current slab. For now, we'll apply funding to ALL exposures
// with a matching slab_idx. This requires the caller to ensure slabs are passed
// in the correct order matching the portfolio's slab indices.
//
// For now, we'll apply funding unconditionally (conservative - may apply
// funding multiple times for same position if same slab is touched multiple times,
// but the verified function is idempotent so this is safe).
```

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Test Coverage

#### 2. LP Insolvency Test Implementation
**Location**: `cli/src/tests.rs:1214-1265`
**Issue**: Critical LP liquidation tests are placeholders
**Risk**: LP insolvency scenarios not validated in integration tests
**Impact**: Production LP liquidation could fail or cause losses
```rust
// TODO: Implement when liquidity::add_liquidity() is available
// TODO: Implement when liquidity functions are available
// TODO: Implement isolation verification
```

#### 3. Disabled Router Tests
**Location**: `programs/router/src/instructions/router_reserve.rs:62`, `router_release.rs:57`
**Issue**: Test modules disabled due to API changes
**Risk**: Router reserve/release operations not unit tested
**Impact**: Potential bugs in collateral reservation logic
```rust
#[cfg(disabled_test)] // TODO: Update tests for new Portfolio and AccountInfo APIs
```

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Development

#### 4. AMM Result Return Serialization
**Location**: `programs/amm/src/entrypoint.rs:155-156`
**Issue**: Liquidity results not returned to caller
**Risk**: AMM operations appear to fail even when successful
**Impact**: Poor user experience, debugging difficulty
```rust
// TODO: Return LiquidityResult to caller (requires result serialization)
let _ = result;
```

## Placeholder Implementations Found (15 locations)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Functionality Impact

#### 5. LP Insolvency Test Stubs
**Location**: `cli/src/tests.rs:1233, 1257, 1275`
**Issue**: Complete test functions are no-ops with warning messages
**Risk**: LP liquidation edge cases not tested
**Impact**: Production LP insolvency could cause system-wide losses
```rust
println!("{}", "  ‚ö† AMM LP insolvency tests not yet implemented (liquidity module stub)".yellow());
Ok(())
```

#### 6. AMM Liquidity Functions
**Location**: `programs/router/src/lp_adapter_serde.rs:31-32, 34`
**Issue**: Advanced liquidity operations not implemented
**Risk**: Limited DEX functionality (no concentrated liquidity, hooks)
**Impact**: Reduced capital efficiency, fewer trading strategies
```rust
/// - 1: ObAdd { ... } (not implemented yet)
/// - 2: Hook { ... } (not implemented yet)
/// - 4: Modify { ... } (not implemented yet)
```

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Hardcoded Values

#### 7. CLI Liquidity Parameters
**Location**: `cli/src/liquidity.rs:168-169`
**Issue**: Liquidity parameters use placeholder values
**Risk**: Invalid AMM pool creation
**Impact**: AMM pools may not function correctly
```rust
liquidity_data.extend_from_slice(&0u128.to_le_bytes()); // lower_px_q64 (placeholder)
liquidity_data.extend_from_slice(&u128::MAX.to_le_bytes()); // upper_px_q64 (placeholder)
```

#### 8. CLI Matcher Version Hash
**Location**: `cli/src/matcher.rs:58`
**Issue**: Slab registration uses zero version hash
**Risk**: Governance cannot track slab versions
**Impact**: Reduced auditability and upgrade safety
```rust
instruction_data.extend_from_slice(&[0u8; 32]); // version_hash (placeholder)
```

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Test Placeholders

#### 9. Slab Funding Tests
**Location**: `programs/slab/src/instructions/update_funding.rs:115-118, 121-123`
**Issue**: Test functions are empty placeholders
**Risk**: Funding rate updates not validated
**Impact**: Funding bugs may go undetected
```rust
fn test_update_funding_basic() {
    // This is a placeholder test - real tests would require Clock mock
    // In production, use integration tests with solana-test-validator
}
```

#### 10. Router Test Modules
**Location**: `programs/router/src/instructions/initialize_test.rs:28-32`, `register_slab_test.rs:11-13`
**Issue**: Test functions assert true without validation
**Risk**: Router initialization not tested
**Impact**: Initialization bugs may exist
```rust
#[test]
fn test_placeholder() {
    // Placeholder test to ensure module compiles
    assert!(true);
}
```

#### 11. Account Validation Tests
**Location**: `programs/common/src/account.rs:196, 198-201`
**Issue**: Tests acknowledge they're placeholders
**Risk**: Account validation logic not tested
**Impact**: Invalid accounts may be accepted
```rust
// Note: Full account validation tests require Solana runtime
// These are placeholder tests for compilation
```

## Incomplete Features Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Missing Core Functionality

#### 12. LP Liquidity Provision
**Status**: Partially Implemented
**Missing**: AMM liquidity addition, advanced order types, position modification
**Impact**: DEX cannot offer full liquidity provision features
**Risk**: Reduced capital efficiency, fewer user strategies

#### 13. AMM Operations
**Status**: Basic Implementation
**Missing**: Result serialization, advanced liquidity management
**Impact**: AMM operations appear to fail, poor UX
**Risk**: User confusion, operational issues

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Test Coverage Gaps

#### 14. Integration Test Gaps
**Status**: CLI tests have significant placeholders
**Missing**: Real funding tests, LP insolvency validation, multi-slab scenarios
**Impact**: Critical paths not validated in real environments
**Risk**: Production bugs in high-value operations

#### 15. Unit Test Gaps
**Status**: Some modules have placeholder tests
**Missing**: Router instruction validation, slab funding updates
**Impact**: Lower confidence in code correctness
**Risk**: Implementation bugs may exist

## Security Impact Analysis

### Critical Security Risks

1. **Funding Over-Application**: The TODO in execute_cross_slab.rs explicitly acknowledges that funding may be applied multiple times. While claimed to be "safe" due to idempotence, this could still cause user confusion and unexpected fee charges.

2. **LP Insolvency Blind Spots**: Missing LP insolvency tests means the system could fail catastrophically during liquidity provider liquidations, potentially causing system-wide losses.

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Significant portions of critical functionality lack proper testing, increasing the risk of undiscovered bugs.

### Medium Security Risks

4. **Hardcoded Values**: Placeholder values in CLI commands could lead to invalid protocol operations if not updated properly.

5. **Disabled Tests**: Router tests are disabled, potentially hiding bugs in collateral management.

## Functionality Impact Analysis

### Major Functionality Limitations

1. **AMM Liquidity**: Core AMM functionality is incomplete, limiting the DEX's ability to offer advanced liquidity provision.

2. **LP Operations**: Liquidity providers cannot fully participate, reducing overall protocol utility.

3. **Order Types**: Advanced order types are not implemented, limiting trading strategies.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Funding Over-Application**: Implement proper slab-to-position mapping to prevent multiple funding applications.

2. **Implement LP Insolvency Tests**: Complete the placeholder LP tests to validate critical liquidation scenarios.

3. **Enable Router Tests**: Update disabled router tests for new APIs to ensure collateral operations work correctly.

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

4. **Complete AMM Functionality**: Implement result serialization and advanced liquidity operations.

5. **Add Integration Tests**: Create real funding tests and multi-slab scenarios using solana-test-validator.

6. **Replace Hardcoded Values**: Update CLI placeholders with proper parameter handling.

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)

7. **Complete LP Features**: Implement full liquidity provision functionality.

8. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add comprehensive unit tests for all modules.

9. **Code Cleanup**: Remove or complete all placeholder implementations.

## Impact Summary

| Category | Impact Level | Critical Issues | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Security | Medium-High | Funding over-application, LP test gaps | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Attention |
| Functionality | Medium | Incomplete AMM/LP features | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Attention |
| Test Coverage | High | Significant placeholder test coverage | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Attention |
| Maintainability | Low | TODO comments are well-documented | ‚úÖ Good |

## Conclusion

While the codebase demonstrates good development practices with documented TODOs and placeholders, several critical issues require immediate attention. The funding over-application risk and missing LP insolvency tests pose the highest security concerns. The incomplete AMM and LP functionality significantly limits the DEX's capabilities.

**Overall Assessment**: The placeholders and TODOs indicate an actively developed system with known limitations. Most are development artifacts rather than fundamental flaws, but the security and functionality impacts warrant prompt remediation before production deployment.

**Action Required**: Address Priority 1 items before mainnet launch. Complete Priority 2 items within the first major release cycle.</content>
