/// Withdraws SOL from portfolio account to user's wallet.
/// Enforces adaptive warmup throttling on PnL withdrawals.
///
/// # Security Checks
/// - Verifies user is a signer
/// - Verifies portfolio belongs to user
/// - Validates withdrawal amount is non-zero
/// - Checks adaptive warmup withdrawal limit (principal + vested PnL)
/// - Ensures portfolio account remains rent-exempt after withdrawal
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `portfolio_account` - The user's portfolio account (sends SOL)
/// * `portfolio` - Mutable reference to portfolio state
/// * `user_account` - The user's wallet account (receives SOL)
/// * `system_program` - The System Program account
/// * `registry` - The registry account (for warmup state)
/// * `amount` - Amount of lamports to withdraw
